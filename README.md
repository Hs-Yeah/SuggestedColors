## Installation

Go to Edit->Crate SuggestedColors file and a plist will be created. Add colors there with NAME and HEX VALUE

## Important - Do not change plist file name
For now :P

Either

- Install it via [Alcatraz](http://alcatraz.io/)

or

- Clone and build the plugin yourself, it will be installed to the right location automatically by building it.


In any case, relaunch Xcode to load it.
